The 1st workshop on Reliable and Secure Trusted ExEcution Systems (RaSTEES '19) will
take place on October 1, 2019, in Lyon, France, co-located with <a
href="https://srds2019.projet.liris.cnrs.fr/">SRDS 2019</a>.

The reliability and security of distributed systems is a major concern. Indeed,
distributed systems can involve multiple parties that mistrust each others and
are subject to faults. This is a particularly important problem for many
applications that have to handle sensitive and personal data, such as cloud
storage, communication services, etc.  A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is
a practical solution to improving the reliability and security of applications
running in an untrusted environment. Examples of TEEs include Intel SGX, ARM
TrustZone and AMD SME/SEV. Unfortunately, using a TEE is not a straightforward
task. Not only the hardware possesses several limitations, but there is also a
lack of software support for implementing efficient and secure systems.
Consequently many technical challenges need to be overcome. 

The RaSTEES workshop aims at bringing together specialists across the world to
solve these new challenges and help building a better understanding about the
new directions on Trusted Execution Systems research.

The Call for Papers for RaSTEES 2019 will soon be available, please consider
submitting your work.
