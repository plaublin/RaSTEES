The 1st workshop on Reliable and Secure Trusted ExEcution Systems (RaSTEES '19) will
take place on October 1, 2019, in Lyon, France, co-located with SRDS 2019.


Storage systems are the cornerstone for a wide range of applications focusing
distinct fields, such as cloud and high-performance computing, machine
learning, deep learning, transactional and analytical processing, data science,
among others. Each field has very specific needs in terms of performance,
scalability, dependability and security, which raises the need for a new
generation of non-monolithic, configurable and scenario-driven distributed and
reliable storage solutions.

The RaSTEES workshop aims at bringing together specialists across the world to
solve these new challenges and help building a better understanding about the
new directions on Trusted Execution Systems research.

The Call for Papers for RaSTEES 2019 will soon be available, please consider
submitting your work.
