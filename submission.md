## Submission

RaSTEES welcomes submissions in two formats:
1. Regular research papers of at most 6 pages including references. Research
	papers should be work that is not previously published or concurrently
	submitted elsewhere and will be published in the proceedings.
2. Short research statements of at most 1-2 pages. Research statements aim at
	fostering discussion and collaboration. Research statements may summarize
	research published elsewhere or outline new emerging ideas.  Short research
	statements will not be published in the proceedings.

All submissions should be in PDF and must follow the same format as regular
papers of the SRDS â€˜19 conference. Submissions that do not respect the
formatting requirement may be rejected without review.  Reviewing is
single-blind. This means that the names and affiliations of the authors must
appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive at least three reviews
from members of the program committee.

Submissions should be made online at
[https://rastees19.hotcrp.com/](https://rastees19.hotcrp.com/).
